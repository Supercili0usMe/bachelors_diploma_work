## Projects
### Smoking and drinking classification
In this project, I have studied the basic classification methods of machine learning, such as
* K-nearest neighbors (kNN);
* Support Vector Machine (SVM);
* Logistic Regression (LR);
* Decision Tree Classifier (DT);
* Random Forest Classifier (RF);
* Adaptive Boost of Random Forest (AdaBoost);
* Gradient Boosting Random Forest (GradBoost);
* Stacked RF and LR together.

In each jupiter notebook, I: 
1. gave a theoretical description of method being studied, 
2. showed how to create a pipeline with `Standard Scaler` and method,
3. gave an example of how to select optimal hyperparameters using `Halving Grid Search CV`

And as a final, I tested all of these models on Ð° test sample and visualized ROC-curves.
